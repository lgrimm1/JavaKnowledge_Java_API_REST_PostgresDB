Issues:
All entities into one table
Save modifies the record (no deletion-creation)
If Service unable to create proper Payload caused by wrong input data, throw Exception
No CommonService hub, all services into @Components, instead of passing components, directly @Autowired them (e.g. Formulas)
Solve out-of-the-box testability for unprepared postgres database

Commit:
Deleted CommonService, connected services directly to controller; ModelAndView is kept in controller, all services return Payload or throw exception. Model.txt was corrected.

Need:
Modified tests for matching controller and service changes.
