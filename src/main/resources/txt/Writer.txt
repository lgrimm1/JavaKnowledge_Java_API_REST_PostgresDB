WRITER
=================================================================================
Abstract class for handling output streams of character.
Extending subclasses are BufferedWriter, OutputStreamWriter, StringWriter and PrintWriter.
Due to being an abstract class, for declaration use constructor of a subclass.
The stream must be closed after processing in order to release the source.
After closing the stream, any method will raise exception.
The Writer implements the AutoClosable interface, the try-with-resources statement can be used to ensure proper closing.
The concept behind the Writer is similar to the StringBuilder (appending several sequences of data) but in this case, it works with characters.

||Method|Description||
||write(char[] charArray)|writes the characters from the given array||
||write(String string)|writes the characters from the given String||
||append(char c)|inserts the given character to the Writer||
||flush()|forces to write all data from the Writer to the destination||
||close()|closes the stream||

EXAMPLE FOR USAGE:
import java.io.Writer;
import java.io.FileWriter;
...
char[] charArray = ...; //prepare the source character array
String fileName = ...; //external destination file on the storage
try {
    Writer w = new FileWriter(fileName); //attach the destination
    w.write(charArray); //write to the destination
    w.close(); //close the stream (release the source)
}
catch (Exception e) {...} //in case the destination was not accessible

EXAMPLE FOR USAGE WITH TRY-WITH-RESOURCES:
import java.io.Writer;
import java.io.FileWriter;
...
char[] charArray = ...; //prepare the source character array
String fileName = ...; //external destination file on the storage
try (Writer w = new FileWriter(fileName)) {
    w.write(charArray); //write to the destination
}
catch (Exception e) {...} //in case the destination was not accessible
