SPRING BOOT ENTITY VALIDATION
=================================================================================
Coming from the nature of Spring Data JPA, the properness of field data can not be checked (validated) from the constructors or the setters of the entity.
There are two separate ways to apply validation of an entity:
    a. Spring Validation
    b. service class validation methods

The Spring Validation is mainly used for rendering a condition system on the entity fields.
Advantage is that there is a wide variety of conditions available, and it is very fast to apply the conditions themselves.
Disadvantage is that the conditions set on a field become static and there is no flexibility e.g. if the possible maximum value is set on a number field, the maximum can not be changed.

Validation method(s) in service class for the entity below that class provides flexibility since the validation can be parametrized.
Disadvantage is the need of coding.
