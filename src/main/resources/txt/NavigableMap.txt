NAVIGABLEMAP
=================================================================================
Extends the SortedMap interface.
Implementing class is TreeMap.
It is an interface, must use constructor of TreeMap in order to reach its functionalities.

EXAMPLE FOR CREATING INSTANCE BY USING A CONSTRUCTOR OF ITS SUBCLASS:
import java.util.NavigableMap;
import java.util.TreeMap;
...
NavigableMap<keyType, valueType> nm = new TreeMap<>();
END OF EXAMPLE

All methods of SortedMap are available. However, headMap(), tailMap(), and subMap() are defined differently.
Specific methods are below.

||METHOD|DESCRIPTION||
||headMap(key, [includingKey])|returns all entries with keys less than passed key, includingKey as true makes the key to be included, default is false||
||tailMap(key, [includingKey])|returns all entries with keys greater than passed key, includingKey as true makes the key to be included, default is true||
||subMap(key1, [includingKey1], key2, [includingKey2])|returns all entries with keys within [key1, key2] interval, includingKeyX as true makes the given key to be included, defaults are true and false||
||descendingMap()|reverse the order of entries||
||descendingKeyMap()|reverses the order of keys||
||ceilingEntry(key)|returns an entry with the lowest key from keys greater or equal than the passed key||
||ceilingKey(key)|returns the lowest key from keys greater or equal than the passed key||
||floorEntry(key)|returns an entry with the highest key from keys less or equal than the passed key||
||floorKey(key)|returns the highest key from keys less or equal than the passed key||
||higherEntry(key)|returns an entry with the lowest key from keys greater than the passed key||
||higherKey(key)|returns the lowest key from keys greater than the passed key||
||lowerEntry(key)|returns an entry with the highest key from keys lessthan the passed key||
||lowerKey(key)|returns the highest key from keys less than the passed key||
||firstEntry()|returns the first entry (the entry with the lowest key)||
||lastEntry()|returns the last entry (the entry with the highest key)||
||pollFirstEntry()|returns and removes the first entry (the entry with the lowest key)||
||pollLastEntry()|returns and removes the last entry (the entry with the highest key)||
