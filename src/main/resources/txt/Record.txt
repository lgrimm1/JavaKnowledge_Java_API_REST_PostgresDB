RECORD
=================================================================================
An immutable class where its purpose is to hold data, the next structure is needed:
    a. fields are private final
    b. the only constructor is public and holds all the setters of the fields
    c. there is no explicit setter method (immutable)
    d. the only methods are the getters, equals(), hashCode() and toString() to all fields
In order to create such a data container, a lot of boilerplate code is needed.
Modifying the data container need other coding since the methods should be updated not just the fields.
From Java 17 the whole class can be replaced with a record structure which ensures that the class is a data container for purpose but no need to maintain the rest of the code.

A record is an immutable class which represents data container for given classes (primitives are included).
This structure is equally usable as a class would be.
The method names of getters of the record are originated from the names of the specific fields.
The toString() method will give different result from the usual.
Fields and methods of the record can be accessed via using this.fieldName and this.methodName().

EXAMPLE FOR A SIMPLE RECORD:
public record RecordName (FieldType1 fieldName1, FieldType2 fieldName2) {}
...
FieldType1 name1 = ...;
FieldType2 name2 = ...;
RecordName names = new RecordName(name1, name2);
FieldType1 var1 = names.fieldName1();
FieldType2 var2 = names.fieldName2();
String s = names.toString(); //RecordName[fieldName1=..., fieldName2=...]
RecordName newNames = new RecordName(name1, name2);
boolean b = names.equals(newNames);
assertEquals(names.hashCode(), newNames.hashCode());

A record can be extended:
    a. overloading its constructor
    b. adding additional constructors
    c. adding additional (static) fields
    d. adding additional (static) methods
The this keyword points to the record itself, the this() method points to the original (automatically generated) constructor.
Overloading the automatically created constructor is valid, however, overloading again with the same method signature is not allowed.

EXAMPLE FOR OVERLOADING CONSTRUCTOR OF A RECORD:
public record RecordName (FieldType1 fieldName1, FieldType2 fieldName2) {
    public RecordName(FieldType1 fieldName1, FieldType2 fieldName2) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(fieldName1);
        Objects.requireNonNull(fieldName2);
    }
}

EXAMPLE FOR ADDING NEW CONSTRUCTOR TO A RECORD:
public record RecordName (FieldType1 fieldName1, FieldType2 fieldName2) {
    public RecordName(FieldType1 fieldName1) {
        this(fieldName1, valueForFieldName2);
    }
}

EXAMPLE FOR ADDING STATIC CONTENT TO A RECORD:
public record RecordName (FieldType1 fieldName1, FieldType2 fieldName2) {
    public static FieldType3 fieldName = ...;
    public static returnType4 methodName4(...) {
        return ...;
    }
}
...
FieldType3 var3 = RecordName.fieldName3;
returnType4 var4 = RecordName.methodName4(...);
