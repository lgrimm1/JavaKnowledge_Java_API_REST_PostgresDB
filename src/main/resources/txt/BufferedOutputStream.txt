BUFFEREDOUTPUTSTREAM
=================================================================================
Extends the OutputStream abstract class.
Used with other output streams to write the data (in bytes) more efficiently.
Maintains an internal buffer of 8192 bytes by default.
Data are not written directly to the storage but into in the internal buffer. Once the buffer is filled or the stream is closed, the whole buffer will be written to the storage. With this, the number of communication to the disk is reduced causing faster operations.
All methods are available from OutputStream. Special methods are below.

||Method|Description||
||write(byte[] byteArray)|sends a byte to the file stream||
||write(byte[] byteArray)|sends all bytes to the file stream from the given byte array||
||write(byte[] byteArray, int position, int length)|sends length amount of bytes to the file stream from the given byte array at its position||
||flush()|forces the buffer to send all its data to the file stream||

EXAMPLE FOR USAGE:
import java.io.BufferedOutputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
...
String string = ...; //original data in case it is String
byte[] byteArray = string.getBytes(); //original data, in this case converted from String
try {
    //declare streams
    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(String file); //create file stream for output, see constructors at FileOutputStream
    BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos); //create buffered stream with linking the file stream to it with default buffer size; or:
    BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos, int bufferSize); //create buffered stream with linking the file stream to it with bufferSize buffer size
    //process data, version 1
    for (byte b : byteArray) {
        bos.write(b);
    }
    //process data, version 2
    bos.write(byteArray);
    //close streams
    bis.close();
    fis.close();
}
catch (Exception e) {...}
