STRINGREADER
=================================================================================
Extends Reader.
Its purpose is to read data in characters from a String.
In case a method tries to access data after the end of the source (accessed length is greater than the actually available), exception raises.
The stream must be closed after processing in order to release the source String.
After closing the stream, any method will raise exception.
The StringReader implements the AutoClosable interface, the try-with-resources statement can be used to ensure proper closing.
Available methods are below.

||Method|Description||
||read()|reads a single character||
||read(char[] characterArray)|reads characters into the given character array||
||read(char[] characterArray, int start, int length)|reads length number of characters into the given character array from its start index||
||skip()|skips the given amount of characters||
||close()|closes the stream reader||
||ready()|checks whether the source stream is ready to be read||
||mark()|marks the position in the stream it was read until||
||reset()|returns the position to the marked position||

EXAMPLE FOR USAGE:
import java.io.StringReader;
...
String string = ...; //the data to be read
try {
    char[] characterArray = new char[100]; //set up a character array
    StringReader stringReader = new StringReader(string); //attach the source
    stringReader.read(characterArray); //read the source into array
    stringReader.close(); //close the input stream (release the source)
}
catch (Exception e) {...} //in case the source was not accessible

EXAMPLE FOR USAGE WITH TRY-WITH-RESOURCES:
import java.io.StringReader;
...
try (StringReader stringReader = new StringReader(string)) {
    char[] characterArray = new char[100]; //set up a character array
    stringReader.read(characterArray); //read the source into array
}
catch (Exception e) {...} //in case the source was not accessible
