PRINTWRITER
=================================================================================
Extends Writer.
Its purpose is to write output data in commonly readable form (text).
Converts primitive data into text format, then sends it to the writer.
Does not throw exceptions, success can be checked with checkError() method.
Uses optional auto flushing (specified with constructor) when using println() or printf() methods.
After closing the stream, any method will raise exception.
The PrintWriter implements the AutoClosable interface, the try-with-resources statement can be used to ensure proper closing.
Uses default character set but other encoding (e.g. UTF8 or UTF16) can be used as well.
The written data can be formatted. The methodology follows the String formatting.

Constructors:
    a. use other writer (e.g. a previously declared FileWriter)
    b. use other output stream (e.g. a previously declared FileOutputStream)
    c. use an output file name

Constructor parameters:
    a. (writer or output stream)
    b. (writer or output stream, boolean autoFlush)
    c. (writer or output stream, boolean autoFlush, Charset charset)

||Method|Description||
||print()|sends the data to the writer||
||println()|sends the data to the writer, puts a line end character to the end||
||printf()|sends the data to the writer in formatted ways, arguments are the formatting rule and the data||
||checkError()|returns whether there was an error with the last used method||
||append()|appends the given data to the writer||
||close()|closes the print writer||

EXAMPLE FOR USAGE:
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
...
String string = ...; //prepare data
try {
    FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(fileName);
    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(fileWriter, true);
    printWriter.print(string); //send to the writer
    printWriter.close(); //close the print writer (release the stream)
    fileWriter.close(); //close the stream (release the source)
}
catch (Exception e) {...} //in case the destination or the accessed writer was not accessible on declaring

EXAMPLE FOR USAGE WITH TRY-WITH-RESOURCES:
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
...
String string = ...; //prepare data
try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(fileName); PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(fileWriter, true)) {
    printWriter.print(string); //send to the writer
}
catch (Exception e) {...} //in case the destination or the accessed writer was not accessible on declaring
