LINKEDHASHSET
=================================================================================
Implements the Set interface.
Provides hashtable and linked list data structure.
Elements are stored in hash tables similar to HashSet but internally, data are stored with double-linked list. That said, it stores the order as elements were added to the set.
Need more storage and has slower speed, compared to HashSet.

Constructor signatures:
    a. (): default capacity is 16, default load factor is 0.75
    b. (capacity in int, load factor in float): how many elements it can store, if load factor is exceeded, the set is moved to an other set with double size
    c. (other Set class): converting from that set to LinkedHashSet; need identical pair types

EXAMPLE FOR CREATING AN INSTANCE:
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;
...
LinkedHashSet<elementType> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();

All methods of Set are available. Other methods are below.
Because the element adding order is stored, e.g. the toArray(), toString(), iterator() methods will follow that order.
